        # üé≤ Mathematical Probability: First Steps

In this notebook, we'll explore the
        fundamental approaches to understanding probability.

        ## What is Probability?

        Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It's a number between 
        0 (impossible) and 1 (certain).

        We'll explore two main approaches:

        - üìä Empirical (Experimental) Approach

    Try this:

    1. A fair die is rolled. What's the classical probability of getting a 6?

    2. If you roll a die 100 times and get 20 sixes, what's the empirical probability?

    3. Which would you trust more in this case, and why?

    <details>
    <summary>Click for answers!</summary>

    1. Classical: P(6) = 1/6 ‚âà 0.167 <br>
    2. Empirical: P(6) = 20/100 = 0.200 <br>
    3. Classical would be more reliable here because we know the die is fair!
