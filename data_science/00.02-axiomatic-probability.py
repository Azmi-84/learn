        ## The Three Fundamental Axioms

        Probability theory is built on three fundamental axioms:

        1. **Non-Negativity**: Probabilities can't be negative
           - $P(A) â‰¥ 0$ for any event A

        2. **Normalization**: The probability of the entire sample space is 1
           - $P(S) = 1$ where S is the sample space

        3. **Additivity**: For mutually exclusive events, probabilities add
           - $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$ when $A \cap B = \emptyset$

        Let's explore these with simple examples.

        ### Understanding Axioms Through Events

        Before we explore each axiom in detail, let's use a simple dice roll to see how these rules work in practice. 
        This interactive example demonstrates all three axioms:

        - All probabilities shown will be 0 or greater
        - The probability of all possible rolls (1-6) is 1
        - When we consider events like "rolling an even number", we're adding individual probabilities

        Try different events below to see how probabilities behave according to these rules:
