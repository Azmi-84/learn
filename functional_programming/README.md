# Learn Functional Programming

_ðŸš§ This collection is a [work in progress](https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/issues/51)._

This series of marimo notebooks introduces the powerful paradigm of functional
programming through Python. Taking inspiration from Haskell and Category
Theory, we'll build a strong foundation in FP concepts that can transform how
you approach software development.

## What You'll Learn

**Using only Python's standard library**, we'll construct functional
programming concepts from first principles.

Topics include:

+ Currying and higher-order functions
+ Functors, Applicatives, and Monads
+ Category theory fundamentals

## Running Notebooks

### Locally

To run a notebook locally, use

```bash 
uvx marimo edit <URL> 
```

For example, run the `Functor` tutorial with

```bash 
uvx marimo edit https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/blob/main/functional_programming/05_functors.py
```

### On Our Online Playground

You can also open notebooks in our online playground by appending `marimo.app/` to a notebook's URL like:

https://marimo.app/https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/blob/main/functional_programming/05_functors.py

### On Our Landing Page
