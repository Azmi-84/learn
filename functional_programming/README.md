# Functional Programming in Python with Marimo

_ðŸš§ This collection is a [work in progress](https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/issues/51)._

This series of marimo notebooks introduces the powerful paradigm of functional programming through Python. Taking inspiration from Haskell and Category Theory, we'll build a strong foundation in FP concepts that can transform how you approach software development.

## What You'll Learn

Using only Python's standard library, we'll construct functional programming concepts from first principles.

Topics include:
- Recursion and higher-order functions
- Category theory fundamentals
- Functors, applicatives, and monads
- Composable abstractions for robust code

## Timeline & Collaboration

I'm currently studying functional programming and Haskell, estimating about 2 months to complete this series. The structure may evolve as the project develops.

If you're interested in collaborating or have questions, please reach out to me on Discord (@eugene.hs). I welcome contributors who share an interest in bringing functional programming concepts to the Python ecosystem.

**Running notebooks.** To run a notebook locally, use

```bash
uvx marimo edit <URL>
```

For example, run the `Functor` tutorial with

```bash
uvx marimo edit https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/blob/main/Functional_programming/05_functors.py
```

You can also open notebooks in our online playground by appending `marimo.app/`
to a notebook's URL: [marimo.app/github.com/marimo-team/learn/blob/main/functional_programming/05_functors.py](https://marimo.app/https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/blob/main/functional_programming/05_functors.py).

# Description of notebooks

## 05. Category and Functors

In [this notebook](https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/blob/main/Functional_programming/05_functors.py), you would learn:

* Why `len` is the *Functor* from the category of `list concatentation` to the category of `integer addition`
* How to *lift* an ordinary function to a specific *computation context*
* How to write an *adpter* between two categories
