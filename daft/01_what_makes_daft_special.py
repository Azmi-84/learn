    # What Makes Daft Special?

    > _By [P√©ter Ferenc Gyarmati](http://github.com/peter-gy)_.

    Welcome to the course on [Daft](https://www.getdaft.io/), the distributed dataframe library! In this first chapter, we'll explore what Daft is and what makes it a noteworthy tool in the landscape of data processing. We'll look at its core design choices and how they aim to help you work with data more effectively, whether you're a data engineer, data scientist, or analyst.

    ## üéØ Introducing Daft: A Unified Data Engine

    Daft is a distributed query engine designed to handle a wide array of data tasks, from data engineering and analytics to powering ML/AI workflows. It provides both a Python DataFrame API, familiar to users of libraries like Pandas, and a SQL interface, allowing you to choose the interaction style that best suits your needs or the task at hand.

    The main goal of Daft is to provide a robust and versatile platform for processing data, whether it's gigabytes on your laptop or petabytes on a cluster.

    ## ü¶Ä Built with Rust: Performance and Simplicity

    One of Daft's key characteristics is that its core engine is written in Rust. This choice has several implications for users:

    *   **Performance**: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is known for its speed and memory efficiency. Unlike systems built on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Rust doesn't have a garbage collector that can introduce unpredictable pauses. This often translates to faster execution and more predictable performance.
    *   **Efficient Python Integration**: Daft uses Rust's native Python bindings. This allows Python code (like your DataFrame operations or User-Defined Functions, which we'll cover later) to interact closely with the Rust engine. This can reduce the overhead often seen when bridging Python with JVM-based systems (e.g., PySpark), especially for custom Python logic.
    *   **Simplified Developer Experience**: Rust-based systems typically require less configuration tuning compared to JVM-based systems. You don't need to worry about JVM heap sizes, garbage collection parameters, or managing Java dependencies.

    Daft also leverages [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) for its in-memory data format. This allows for efficient data exchange between Daft's Rust core and Python, often with zero-copy data sharing, further enhancing performance.

    ## üåê Scale Your Work: From Laptop to Cluster

    Daft is designed with scalability in mind. As the trillion-row dataframe example above illustrates, you can write your data processing logic using Daft's Python API, and this same code can run:

    *   **Locally**: Utilizing multiple cores on your laptop or a single powerful machine for development or processing moderately sized datasets.
    *   **On a Cluster**: By integrating with [Ray](https://www.ray.io/), a framework for distributed computing. This allows Daft to scale out to process very large datasets across many machines.

    This "write once, scale anywhere" approach means you don't need to significantly refactor your code when moving from local development to large-scale distributed execution. We'll delve into distributed computing with Ray in a later chapter.

    ## üñºÔ∏è Handling More Than Just Tables: Multimodal Data Support

    Modern datasets often contain more than just numbers and text. They might include images, audio clips, URLs pointing to external files, tensor data from machine learning models, or complex nested structures like JSON.

    Daft is built to accommodate these **multimodal data types** as integral parts of a DataFrame. This means you can have columns containing image data, embeddings, or other complex Python objects, and Daft provides mechanisms to process them. This is particularly useful for ML/AI pipelines and advanced analytics where diverse data sources are common.

    As an example of how Daft simplifies working with such complex data, let's see how we can process image URLs. With just a few lines of Daft code, we can pull open data from the [National Gallery of Art](https://github.com/NationalGalleryOfArt/opendata), then directly fetch, decode, and even resize the images within our DataFrame:

    ## üü£ Daft's Value Proposition

    So, what makes Daft special? It's the combination of these design choices:

    *   A **Rust-based core engine** provides a solid foundation for performance and memory management.
    *   **Built-in scalability** means your code can transition from local development to distributed clusters (with Ray) with minimal changes.
    *   **Native handling of multimodal data** opens doors for complex ML/AI and analytics tasks that go beyond traditional tabular data.
    *   **Developer-centric Python and SQL APIs** offer flexibility and ease of use.

    These elements combine to make Daft a versatile tool for tackling modern data challenges.

    And this is just scratching the surface. Daft is a growing data engine with an ambitious vision: to unify data engineering, analytics, and ML/AI workflows üöÄ.
