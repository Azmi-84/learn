        ## Matplotlib Gotchas

        While most `plt` functions translate directly to `ax` methods (`plt.plot` â†’ `ax.plot`, `plt.legend` â†’ `ax.legend`, etc.), this is not the case for all commands.
        In particular, functions to set limits, labels, and titles are slightly modified.
        For transitioning between MATLAB-style functions and object-oriented methods, make the following changes:

        - `plt.xlabel`  â†’ `ax.set_xlabel`
        - `plt.ylabel` â†’ `ax.set_ylabel`
        - `plt.xlim`  â†’ `ax.set_xlim`
        - `plt.ylim` â†’ `ax.set_ylim`
        - `plt.title` â†’ `ax.set_title`

        In the object-oriented interface to plotting, rather than calling these functions individually, it is often more convenient to use the `ax.set` method to set all these properties at once (see the following figure):
        """
