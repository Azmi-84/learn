        This part of the book has explored a number of the central concepts and algorithms of machine learning.
        But moving from these concepts to a real-world application can be a challenge.
        Real-world datasets are noisy and heterogeneous; they may have missing features, and data may be in a form that is difficult to map to a clean `[n_samples, n_features]` matrix.
        Before applying any of the methods discussed here, you must first extract these features from your data: there is no formula for how to do this that applies across all domains, and thus this is where you as a data scientist must exercise your own intuition and expertise.

        One interesting and compelling application of machine learning is to images, and we have already seen a few examples of this where pixel-level features are used for classification.
        Again, the real world data is rarely so uniform, and simple pixels will not be suitable: this has led to a large literature on *feature extraction* methods for image data (see [Feature Engineering](05.04-Feature-Engineering.ipynb)).

        In this chapter we will take a look at one such feature extraction technique: the [histogram of oriented gradients (HOG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients), which transforms image pixels into a vector representation that is sensitive to broadly informative image features regardless of confounding factors like illumination.
        We will use these features to develop a simple face detection pipeline, using machine learning algorithms and concepts we've seen throughout this part of the book.

        ## HOG Features

        HOG is a straightforward feature extraction procedure that was developed in the context of identifying pedestrians within images.
        It involves the following steps:

        1. Optionally prenormalize the images. This leads to features that resist dependence on variations in illumination.
        2. Convolve the image with two filters that are sensitive to horizontal and vertical brightness gradients. These capture edge, contour, and texture information.
        3. Subdivide the image into cells of a predetermined size, and compute a histogram of the gradient orientations within each cell.
        4. Normalize the histograms in each cell by comparing to the block of neighboring cells. This further suppresses the effect of illumination across the image.
        5. Construct a one-dimensional feature vector from the information in each cell.

        A fast HOG extractor is built into the Scikit-Image project, and we can try it out relatively quickly and visualize the oriented gradients within each cell (see the following figure):

        ## HOG in Action: A Simple Face Detector

        Using these HOG features, we can build up a simple facial detection algorithm with any Scikit-Learn estimator; here we will use a linear support vector machine (refer back to [In-Depth: Support Vector Machines](05.07-Support-Vector-Machines.ipynb) if you need a refresher on this).
        The steps are as follows:

        1. Obtain a set of image thumbnails of faces to constitute "positive" training samples.
        2. Obtain a set of image thumbnails of non-faces to constitute "negative" training samples.
        3. Extract HOG features from these training samples.
        4. Train a linear SVM classifier on these samples.
        5. For an "unknown" image, pass a sliding window across the image, using the model to evaluate whether that window contains a face or not.
        6. If detections overlap, combine them into a single window.

        ## Caveats and Improvements

        If you dig a bit deeper into the preceding code and examples, you'll see that we still have a bit of work to do before we can claim a production-ready face detector.
        There are several issues with what we've done, and several improvements that could be made. In particular:

        **Our training set, especially for negative features, is not very complete**

        The central issue is that there are many face-like textures that are not in the training set, and so our current model is very prone to false positives.
        You can see this if you try out the algorithm on the *full* astronaut image: the current model leads to many false detections in other regions of the image.

        We might imagine addressing this by adding a wider variety of images to the negative training set, and this would probably yield some improvement.
        Another option would be to use a more directed approach, such as *hard negative mining*, where we take a new set of images that our classifier has not seen, find all the patches representing false positives, and explicitly add them as negative instances in the training set before retraining the classifier.

        **Our current pipeline searches only at one scale**

        As currently written, our algorithm will miss faces that are not approximately 62 Ã— 47 pixels.
        This can be straightforwardly addressed by using sliding windows of a variety of sizes, and resizing each patch using `skimage.transform.resize` before feeding it into the model.
        In fact, the `sliding_window` utility used here is already built with this in mind.

        **We should combine overlapped detection patches**

        For a production-ready pipeline, we would prefer not to have 30 detections of the same face, but to somehow reduce overlapping groups of detections down to a single detection.
        This could be done via an unsupervised clustering approach (mean shift clustering is one good candidate for this), or via a procedural approach such as *non-maximum suppression*, an algorithm common in machine vision.

        **The pipeline should be streamlined**

        Once we address the preceding issues, it would also be nice to create a more streamlined pipeline for ingesting training images and predicting sliding-window outputs.
        This is where Python as a data science tool really shines: with a bit of work, we could take our prototype code and package it with a well-designed object-oriented API that gives the user the ability to use it easily.
        I will leave this as a proverbial "exercise for the reader."

        **More recent advances: deep learning**

        Finally, I should add that in machine learning contexts, HOG and other procedural feature extraction methods are not always used.
        Instead, many modern object detection pipelines use variants of deep neural networks (often referred to as *deep learning*): one way to think of neural networks is as estimators that determine optimal feature extraction strategies from the data, rather than relying on the intuition of the user.

        Though the field has produced fantastic results in recent years, deep learning is not all that conceptually different from the machine learning models explored in the previous chapters.
        The main advance is the ability to utilize modern computing hardware (often large clusters of powerful machines) to train much more flexible models on much larger corpuses of training data.
        But though the scale differs, the end goal is very much the same the same: building models from data.

        If you're interested in going further, the list of references in the following section should provide a useful place to start!
