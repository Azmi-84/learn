        There are several Python libraries that provide solid implementations of a range of machine learning algorithms.
        One of the best known is [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org), a package that provides efficient versions of a large number of common algorithms.
        Scikit-Learn is characterized by a clean, uniform, and streamlined API, as well as by very useful and complete online documentation.
        A benefit of this uniformity is that once you understand the basic use and syntax of Scikit-Learn for one type of model, switching to a new model or algorithm is straightforward.

        This chapter provides an overview of the Scikit-Learn API. A solid understanding of these API elements will form the foundation for understanding the deeper practical discussion of machine learning algorithms and approaches in the following chapters.

        We will start by covering data representation in Scikit-Learn, then delve into the Estimator API, and finally go through a more interesting example of using these tools for exploring a set of images of handwritten digits.

        The table layout makes clear that the information can be thought of as a two-dimensional numerical array or matrix, which we will call the *features matrix*.

        For example, a sample might represent a flower, a person, a document, an image, a sound file, a video, an astronomical object, or anything else you can describe with a set of quantitative measurements.

        The features (i.e., columns) always refer to the distinct observations that describe each sample in a quantitative manner.

        ### The Target Array

        In addition to the feature matrix `X`, we also generally work with a *label* or *target* array, which by convention we will usually call `y`.
        The target array is usually one-dimensional, with length `n_samples`, and is generally contained in a NumPy array or Pandas `Series`.
        The target array may have continuous numerical values, or discrete classes/labels.
        While some Scikit-Learn estimators do handle multiple target values in the form of a two-dimensional, `[n_samples, n_targets]` target array, we will primarily be working with the common case of a one-dimensional target array.

        A common point of confusion is how the target array differs from the other feature columns. The distinguishing characteristic of the target array is that it is usually the quantity we want to *predict from the features*: in statistical terms, it is the dependent variable.
        For example, given the preceding data we may wish to construct a model that can predict the species of flower based on the other measurements; in this case, the `species` column would be considered the target array.

        With this target array in mind, we can use Seaborn (discussed in [Visualization With Seaborn](04.14-Visualization-With-Seaborn.ipynb)) to conveniently visualize the data (see the following figure):

        The Scikit-Learn API is designed with the following guiding principles in mind, as outlined in the [Scikit-Learn API paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0238):

        - *Consistency*: All objects share a common interface drawn from a limited set of methods, with consistent documentation.

        - *Inspection*: All specified parameter values are exposed as public attributes.

        - *Limited object hierarchy*: Only algorithms are represented by Python classes; datasets are represented
          in standard formats (NumPy arrays, Pandas `DataFrame` objects, SciPy sparse matrices) and parameter
          names use standard Python strings.

        - *Composition*: Many machine learning tasks can be expressed as sequences of more fundamental algorithms,
          and Scikit-Learn makes use of this wherever possible.

        - *Sensible defaults*: When models require user-specified parameters, the library defines an appropriate default value.

        In practice, these principles make Scikit-Learn very easy to use, once the basic principles are understood.
        Every machine learning algorithm in Scikit-Learn is implemented via the Estimator API, which provides a consistent interface for a wide range of machine learning applications.

        Most commonly, the steps in using the Scikit-Learn Estimator API are as follows:

        1. Choose a class of model by importing the appropriate estimator class from Scikit-Learn.
        2. Choose model hyperparameters by instantiating this class with desired values.
        3. Arrange data into a features matrix and target vector, as outlined earlier in this chapter.
        4. Fit the model to your data by calling the `fit` method of the model instance.
        5. Apply the model to new data:
           - For supervised learning, often we predict labels for unknown data using the `predict` method.
           - For unsupervised learning, we often transform or infer properties of the data using the `transform` or `predict` method.

        We will now step through several simple examples of applying supervised and unsupervised learning methods.

        #### 2. Choose model hyperparameters

        An important point is that *a class of model is not the same as an instance of a model*.

        Once we have decided on our model class, there are still some options open to us.
        Depending on the model class we are working with, we might need to answer one or more questions like the following:

        - Would we like to fit for the offset (i.e., *y*-intercept)?
        - Would we like the model to be normalized?
        - Would we like to preprocess our features to add model flexibility?
        - What degree of regularization would we like to use in our model?
        - How many model components would we like to use?

        These are examples of the important choices that must be made *once the model class is selected*.
        These choices are often represented as *hyperparameters*, or parameters that must be set before the model is fit to data.
        In Scikit-Learn, hyperparameters are chosen by passing values at model instantiation.
        We will explore how you can quantitatively choose hyperparameters in [Hyperparameters and Model Validation](05.03-Hyperparameters-and-Model-Validation.ipynb).

        For our linear regression example, we can instantiate the `LinearRegression` class and specify that we would like to fit the intercept using the `fit_intercept` hyperparameter:

        Let's take a look at another example of this process, using the Iris dataset we discussed earlier.

        As an example of an unsupervised learning problem, let's take a look at reducing the dimensionality of the Iris data so as to more easily visualize it.

        The task of dimensionality reduction centers around determining whether there is a suitable lower-dimensional representation that retains the essential features of the data.
        Often dimensionality reduction is used as an aid to visualizing data: after all, it is much easier to plot data in two dimensions than in four dimensions or more!

        This plot gives us some good intuition into how well various numbers are separated in the larger 64-dimensional space. For example, zeros and ones have very little overlap in the parameter space.
        Intuitively, this makes sense: a zero is empty in the middle of the image, while a one will generally have ink in the middle.
        On the other hand, there seems to be a more or less continuous spectrum between ones and fours: we can understand this by realizing that some people draw ones with "hats" on them, which causes them to look similar to fours.

        Overall, however, despite some mixing at the edges, the different groups appear to be fairly well localized in the parameter space: this suggests that even a very straightforward supervised classification algorithm should perform suitably on the full high-dimensional dataset.
