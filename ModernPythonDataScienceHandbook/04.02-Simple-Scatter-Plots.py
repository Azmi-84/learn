        ## Scatter Plots with plt.scatter

        The primary difference of `plt.scatter` from `plt.plot` is that it can be used to create scatter plots where the properties of each individual point (size, face color, edge color, etc.) can be individually controlled or mapped to data.

        Let's show this by creating a random scatter plot with points of many colors and sizes.
        In order to better see the overlapping results, we'll also use the `alpha` keyword to adjust the transparency level (see the following figure):

        In this way, the color and size of points can be used to convey information in the visualization, in order to visualize multidimensional data.

        We can see that this scatter plot has given us the ability to simultaneously explore four different dimensions of the data:
        the (*x*, *y*) location of each point corresponds to the sepal length and width, the size of the point is related to the petal width, and the color is related to the particular species of flower.

        ## plot Versus scatter: A Note on Efficiency

        Aside from the different features available in `plt.plot` and `plt.scatter`, why might you choose to use one over the other? While it doesn't matter as much for small amounts of data, as datasets get larger than a few thousand points, `plt.plot` can be noticeably more efficient than `plt.scatter`.
        The reason is that `plt.scatter` has the capability to render a different size and/or color for each point, so the renderer must do the extra work of constructing each point individually.
        With `plt.plot`, on the other hand, the markers for each point are guaranteed to be identical, so the work of determining the appearance of the points is done only once for the entire set of data.
        For large datasets, this difference can lead to vastly different performance, and for this reason, `plt.plot` should be preferred over `plt.scatter` for large datasets.
