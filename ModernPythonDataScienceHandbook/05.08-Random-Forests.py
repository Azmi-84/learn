        Here we'll take a look at another powerful algorithm: a nonparametric algorithm called *random forests*.
        Random forests are an example of an *ensemble* method, meaning one that relies on aggregating the results of a set of simpler estimators.
        The somewhat surprising result with such ensemble methods is that the sum can be greater than the parts: that is, the predictive accuracy of a majority vote among a number of estimators can end up being better than that of any of the individual estimators doing the voting!
        We will see examples of this in the following sections.

        In this example, we have randomized the data by fitting each estimator with a random subset of 80% of the training points.
        In practice, decision trees are more effectively randomized by injecting some stochasticity in how the splits are chosen: this way all the data contributes to the fit each time, but the results of the fit still have the desired randomness.
        For example, when determining which feature to split on, the randomized tree might select from among the top several features.
        You can read more technical details about these randomization strategies in the [Scikit-Learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#forest) and references within.

        In Scikit-Learn, such an optimized ensemble of randomized decision trees is implemented in the `RandomForestClassifier` estimator, which takes care of all the randomization automatically.

        ## Summary

        This chapter provided a brief introduction to the concept of ensemble estimators, and in particular the random forest, an ensemble of randomized decision trees.
        Random forests are a powerful method with several advantages:

        - Both training and prediction are very fast, because of the simplicity of the underlying decision trees. In addition, both tasks can be straightforwardly parallelized, because the individual trees are entirely independent entities.
        - The multiple trees allow for a probabilistic classification: a majority vote among estimators gives an estimate of the probability (accessed in Scikit-Learn with the `predict_proba` method).
        - The nonparametric model is extremely flexible and can thus perform well on tasks that are underfit by other estimators.

        A primary disadvantage of random forests is that the results are not easily interpretable: that is, if you would like to draw conclusions about the *meaning* of the classification model, random forests may not be the best choice.
