        Matplotlib has been at the core of scientific visualization in Python for decades, but even avid users will admit it often leaves much to be desired.
        There are several complaints about Matplotlib that often come up:

        - A common early complaint, which is now outdated: prior to version 2.0, Matplotlib's color and style defaults were at times poor and looked dated.
        - Matplotlib's API is relatively low-level. Doing sophisticated statistical visualization is possible, but often requires a *lot* of boilerplate code.
        - Matplotlib predated Pandas by more than a decade, and thus is not designed for use with Pandas `DataFrame` objects. In order to visualize data from a `DataFrame`, you must extract each `Series` and often concatenate them together into the right format. It would be nicer to have a plotting library that can intelligently use the `DataFrame` labels in a plot.

        An answer to these problems is [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/). Seaborn provides an API on top of Matplotlib that offers sane choices for plot style and color defaults, defines simple high-level functions for common statistical plot types, and integrates with the functionality provided by Pandas.

        To be fair, the Matplotlib team has adapted to the changing landscape: it added the `plt.style` tools discussed in [Customizing Matplotlib: Configurations and Style Sheets](04.11-Settings-and-Stylesheets.ipynb), and Matplotlib is starting to handle Pandas data more seamlessly.
        But for all the reasons just discussed, Seaborn remains a useful add-on.

        By convention, Seaborn is often imported as `sns`:

        ## Exploring Seaborn Plots

        The main idea of Seaborn is that it provides high-level commands to create a variety of plot types useful for statistical data exploration, and even some statistical model fitting.

        Let's take a look at a few of the datasets and plot types available in Seaborn. Note that all of the following *could* be done using raw Matplotlib commands (this is, in fact, what Seaborn does under the hood), but the Seaborn API is much more convenient.
