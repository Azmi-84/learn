        ## Relational Algebra

        The behavior implemented in `pd.merge` is a subset of what is known as *relational algebra*, which is a formal set of rules for manipulating relational data that forms the conceptual foundation of operations available in most databases.
        The strength of the relational algebra approach is that it proposes several fundamental operations, which become the building blocks of more complicated operations on any dataset.
        With this lexicon of fundamental operations implemented efficiently in a database or other program, a wide range of fairly complicated composite operations can be performed.

        Pandas implements several of these fundamental building blocks in the `pd.merge` function and the related `join` method of `Series` and `DataFrame` objects.
