        Sometimes it is helpful to compare different views of data side by side.
        To this end, Matplotlib has the concept of *subplots*: groups of smaller axes that can exist together within a single figure.
        These subplots might be insets, grids of plots, or other more complicated layouts.

        ## plt.axes: Subplots by Hand

        The most basic method of creating an axes is to use the `plt.axes` function.
        As we've seen previously, by default this creates a standard axes object that fills the entire figure.
        `plt.axes` also takes an optional argument that is a list of four numbers in the figure coordinate system (`[left, bottom, width, height]`), which ranges from 0 at the bottom left of the figure to 1 at the top right of the figure.

        For example, we might create an inset axes at the top-right corner of another axes by setting the *x* and *y* position to 0.65 (that is, starting at 65% of the width and 65% of the height of the figure) and the *x* and *y* extents to 0.2 (that is, the size of the axes is 20% of the width and 20% of the height of the figure). The following figure shows the result:

        ## plt.subplot: Simple Grids of Subplots

        Aligned columns or rows of subplots are a common enough need that Matplotlib has several convenience routines that make them easy to create.
        The lowest level of these is `plt.subplot`, which creates a single subplot within a grid.
        As you can see, this command takes three integer argumentsâ€”the number of rows, the number of columns, and the index of the plot to be created in this scheme, which runs from the upper left to the bottom right (see the following figure):

        ## plt.subplots: The Whole Grid in One Go

        The approach just described quickly becomes tedious when creating a large grid of subplots, especially if you'd like to hide the x- and y-axis labels on the inner plots.
        For this purpose, `plt.subplots` is the easier tool to use (note the `s` at the end of `subplots`). Rather than creating a single subplot, this function creates a full grid of subplots in a single line, returning them in a NumPy array.
        The arguments are the number of rows and number of columns, along with optional keywords `sharex` and `sharey`, which allow you to specify the relationships between different axes.

        Let's create a $2 \times 3$ grid of subplots, where all axes in the same row share their y-axis scale, and all axes in the same column share their x-axis scale (see the following figure):
        """

        ## plt.GridSpec: More Complicated Arrangements

        To go beyond a regular grid to subplots that span multiple rows and columns, `plt.GridSpec` is the best tool.
        `plt.GridSpec` does not create a plot by itself; it is rather a convenient interface that is recognized by the `plt.subplot` command.
