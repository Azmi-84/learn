        ## Plot Customization by Hand

        Throughout this part of the book, you've seen how it is possible to tweak individual plot settings to end up with something that looks a little nicer than the default.
        It's also possible to do these customizations for each individual plot.

        ## Changing the Defaults: rcParams

        Each time Matplotlib loads, it defines a runtime configuration containing the default styles for every plot element you create.
        This configuration can be adjusted at any time using the `plt.rc` convenience routine.
        Let's see how we can modify the rc parameters so that our default plot will look similar to what we did before.

        ## Stylesheets

        A newer mechanism for adjusting overall chart styles is via Matplotlib's `style` module, which includes a number of default stylesheets, as well as the ability to create and package your own styles. These stylesheets are formatted similarly to the *.matplotlibrc* files mentioned earlier, but must be named with a *.mplstyle* extension.

        Even if you don't go as far as creating your own style, you may find what you're looking for in the built-in stylesheets.

        But keep in mind that this will change the style for the rest of the Python session!
