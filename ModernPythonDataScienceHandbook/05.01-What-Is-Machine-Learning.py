        Before we take a look at the details of several machine learning methods, let's start by looking at what machine learning is, and what it isn't.
        Machine learning is often categorized as a subfield of artificial intelligence, but I find that categorization can be misleading.
        The study of machine learning certainly arose from research in this context, but in the data science application of machine learning methods, it's more helpful to think of machine learning as a means of *building models of data*.

        In this context, "learning" enters the fray when we give these models *tunable parameters* that can be adapted to observed data; in this way the program can be considered to be "learning" from the data.
        Once these models have been fit to previously seen data, they can be used to predict and understand aspects of newly observed data.
        I'll leave to the reader the more philosophical digression regarding the extent to which this type of mathematical, model-based "learning" is similar to the "learning" exhibited by the human brain.

        Understanding the problem setting in machine learning is essential to using these tools effectively, and so we will start with some broad categorizations of the types of approaches we'll discuss here.

        ## Categories of Machine Learning

        Machine learning can be categorized into two main types: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

        *Supervised learning* involves somehow modeling the relationship between measured features of data and some labels associated with the data; once this model is determined, it can be used to apply labels to new, unknown data.
        This is sometimes further subdivided into classification tasks and regression tasks: in *classification*, the labels are discrete categories, while in *regression*, the labels are continuous quantities.
        You will see examples of both types of supervised learning in the following section.

        *Unsupervised learning* involves modeling the features of a dataset without reference to any label.
        These models include tasks such as *clustering* and *dimensionality reduction.*
        Clustering algorithms identify distinct groups of data, while dimensionality reduction algorithms search for more succinct representations of the data.
        You will also see examples of both types of unsupervised learning in the following section.

        In addition, there are so-called *semi-supervised learning* methods, which fall somewhere between supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
        Semi-supervised learning methods are often useful when only incomplete labels are available.

        ## Qualitative Examples of Machine Learning Applications

        To make these ideas more concrete, let's take a look at a few very simple examples of a machine learning task.
        These examples are meant to give an intuitive, non-quantitative overview of the types of machine learning tasks we will be looking at in this part of the book.
        In later chapters, we will go into more depth regarding the particular models and how they are used.
        For a preview of these more technical aspects, you can find the Python source that generates the following figures in the online [appendix](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/06.00-Figure-Code.ipynb).

        ### Classification: Predicting Discrete Labels

        We will first take a look at a simple classification task, in which we are given a set of labeled points and want to use these to classify some unlabeled points.

        In addition, we have one of two *class labels* for each point, here represented by the colors of the points.
        From these features and labels, we would like to create a model that will let us decide whether a new point should be labeled "blue" or "red."

        There are a number of possible models for such a classification task, but we will start with a very simple one. We will make the assumption that the two groups can be separated by drawing a straight line through the plane between them, such that points on each side of the line all fall in the same group.
        Here the *model* is a quantitative version of the statement "a straight line separates the classes," while the *model parameters* are the particular numbers describing the location and orientation of that line for our data.
        The optimal values for these model parameters are learned from the data (this is the "learning" in machine learning), which is often called *training the model*.

        See the following figure shows a visual representation of what the trained model looks like for this data.

        This is the basic idea of a classification task in machine learning, where "classification" indicates that the data has discrete class labels.
        At first glance this may seem trivial: it's easy to look at our data and draw such a discriminatory line to accomplish this classification.
        A benefit of the machine learning approach, however, is that it can generalize to much larger datasets in many more dimensions.

        For example, this is similar to the task of automated spam detection for email. In this case, we might use the following features and labels:

        - *feature 1*, *feature 2*, etc. $\to$ normalized counts of important words or phrases ("Viagra", "Extended warranty", etc.)
        - *label* $\to$ "spam" or "not spam"

        For the training set, these labels might be determined by individual inspection of a small representative sample of emails; for the remaining emails, the label would be determined using the model.
        For a suitably trained classification algorithm with enough well-constructed features (typically thousands or millions of words or phrases), this type of approach can be very effective.
        We will see an example of such text-based classification in [In Depth: Naive Bayes Classification](05.05-Naive-Bayes.ipynb).

        Some important classification algorithms that we will discuss in more detail are Gaussian naive Bayes (see [In Depth: Naive Bayes Classification](05.05-Naive-Bayes.ipynb)), support vector machines (see [In-Depth: Support Vector Machines](05.07-Support-Vector-Machines.ipynb)), and random forest classification (see [In-Depth: Decision Trees and Random Forests](05.08-Random-Forests.ipynb)).

        As with the classification example, this task may seem trivial in a low number of dimensions.
        But the power of these methods is that they can be straightforwardly applied and evaluated in the case of data with many, many features.

        For example, this is similar to the task of computing the distance to galaxies observed through a telescopeâ€”in this case, we might use the following features and labels:

        - *feature 1*, *feature 2*, etc. $\to$ brightness of each galaxy at one of several wavelengths or colors
        - *label* $\to$ distance or redshift of the galaxy

        The distances for a small number of these galaxies might be determined through an independent set of (typically more expensive or complex) observations.
        Distances to remaining galaxies could then be estimated using a suitable regression model, without the need to employ the more expensive observation across the entire set.
        In astronomy circles, this is known as the "photometric redshift" problem.

        The classification and regression illustrations we just saw are examples of supervised learning algorithms, in which we are trying to build a model that will predict labels for new data.

        One common case of unsupervised learning is "clustering," in which data is automatically assigned to some number of discrete groups.

        Dimensionality reduction is another example of an unsupervised algorithm, in which labels or other information are inferred from the structure of the dataset itself.

        ## Summary

        Here we have seen a few simple examples of some of the basic types of machine learning approaches.
        Needless to say, there are a number of important practical details that we have glossed over, but this chapter was designed to give you a basic idea of what types of problems machine learning approaches can solve.

        In short, we saw the following:

        - *Supervised learning*: Models that can predict labels based on labeled training data

          - *Classification*: Models that predict labels as two or more discrete categories
          - *Regression*: Models that predict continuous labels
          
        - *Unsupervised learning*: Models that identify structure in unlabeled data

          - *Clustering*: Models that detect and identify distinct groups in the data
          - *Dimensionality reduction*: Models that detect and identify lower-dimensional structure in higher-dimensional data
          
        In the following sections we will go into much greater depth within these categories, and see some more interesting examples of where these concepts can be useful.

        All of the figures in the preceding discussion are generated based on actual machine learning computations; the code behind them can be found in [Appendix: Figure Code](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/06.00-Figure-Code.ipynb).
